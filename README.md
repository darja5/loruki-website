## About the project

This is a learning project created while following a tutorial, with the goal of practicing responsive layout techniques using plain HTML and CSS.

The project focuses on building a clean layout structure, working with Grid and Flexbox, and adapting the design across different screen sizes.
While the initial structure follows a tutorial, it helped me better understand how more experienced developers approach layout and responsiveness.
